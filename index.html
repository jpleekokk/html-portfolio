    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Dedicated and adaptable professional with a diverse 
        background across the pharmaceutical, international trade,
         and quality assurance sectors. Prior to migrating to 
         Australia, I accumulated 1.5 years of experience in
          the pharmaceutical industry and 1 year in international
           trade. In 2013, I moved to Australia to further my
           education and successfully completed a Master of
            International Public Health. Following graduation, 
            I worked as a Quality Assurance Officer on a farm 
            in Melbourne, where I developed a strong foundation 
            in food safety and compliance. Due to the significant
             impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the agricultural
              industry, I returned to Brisbane and co-founded a 
              business with my partner. The business thrived 
              during its initial years, allowing me to settle in 
              Brisbane. Recently, due to business instability and
               a strong passion for healthcare, I am now actively 
               seeking opportunities to return to the
                pharmaceutical and health sector,
                 where I can contribute my skills, education, 
        and experience to make a meaningful impact.</p>
